## Welcome 

Welcome to the RetroLympis repository. This is a project that we have been working on for a while now. It is a launcher for retro challenges.

If you are unfamiliar with GitHub and Programming, fear not! This project is meant to be accesible for everyone.

## Warning About Roms

This project requires that you provide your own roms. We do not and will not help you find them, this is something you have to figure out for yourselves. The team owns all the catridges for the challenges they create.

## Installation

To install the launcher, you will need to download the latest release from the releases tab. You can find the releases tab at the top of the page. Once you have downloaded the zip file, extract it to a folder of your choice. Once you have done that, you can run the RetroLympis.exe file to start the launcher.
